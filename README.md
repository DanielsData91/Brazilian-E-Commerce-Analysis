## Overview
This project aims to uncover hidden sales patterns through exploratory data analysis using Python. The analysis focuses on customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and operational efficiency. Various analytical techniques, including regression and clustering analysis, were applied to gain insights into revenue, customer segmentation, shipping performance, product performance, and time-based sales trends.

## Key Analytical Areas
- **Revenue Analysis**
- **Customer Segmentation Analysis**
- **Efficiency Analysis**
- **Product Performance Analysis**
- **Time-based Trend Analysis**

## Hypothesis Testing
Hypotheses were tested using Regression Analysis and Clustering Analysis:

- **Hypothesis 1:** Higher shipping time leads to longer shipping durations.
- **Hypothesis 2:** Higher product prices correlate with higher freight values.
- **Hypothesis 3:** Longer estimated shipping durations result in higher freight values.

## 1. Project Description
As a data analyst for this project, I conducted an exploratory analysis focusing on revenue, customer segmentation, shipping efficiency, and product performance. The goal was to assess the current state of a Brazilian e-commerce company and support the development of a franchise program. Key objectives included identifying top-performing products, assessing shipping efficiency, and locating high-value customers.
